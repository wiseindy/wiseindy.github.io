	<h1>Blog</h1>

	<p>In addition to apps, websites and a lot of random stuff, I also write solutions/guides/tutorials to problems that I encounter in my day-to-day tech activities. I have created various articles with the intention of saving you time in case you encounter a similar issue.</p>

	<p>Since I work with many different platforms and applications, the guides cover a variety of topics. You can view the most recent blog posts below or view them by <a href="/categories">categories</a> or <a href="/tags">tags</a>.</p>
