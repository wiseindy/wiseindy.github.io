<h1><strong>What is <em>'Experiences'</em>?</strong></h1>
<blockquote>Imagine, if at will, you could rejuvenate yourselves &amp; restore confidence in times of stress, sadness, failure, restlessness, and those sleepless nights.</blockquote>
Well,<i> </i>you don't need to imagine any more.<i> ‘Experiences’</i> is an app for your iPad that feeds your senses a unique blend of videos interwoven with beautiful music &amp; classic quotations that take you away from the stress &amp; tension of this world.
<h1>So, how does it work?</h1>
<blockquote>In life, it's really the little things that matter. These are life's simple pleasures that are commonly overlooked. And possibly everyday sources of happiness can be found within them. Walking down a beach, spending an afternoon in front of a warm cozy fireplace, watching the rain; all these moments make us feel at peace. These little things are the source of pure bliss and joy. This is where true happiness lies.</blockquote>
<em>"Experiences"</em> brings all these moments directly to you. Just after you launch the app, you will be presented with two choices:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">- You can select from one of the default presets, or
- You can also customize an experience according to your specific needs.</p>

<h4><em>Default presets</em></h4>
Some of the default presets from which you can pick from are:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">- I'm having a down day today. I want to feel cheerful.
- I had a stressful day. I want to feel relaxed.
- I keep falling off track. I want to stick to my goals.
- I want to explore the deeper meaning of life.
- and more...</p>
Based on your current mood, you can accordingly pick a experience preset.
<h4><em>Customize your own experience</em></h4>
<blockquote>It is your life. Make it magical.</blockquote>
If you do not choose a preset, there are a total of 15 high quality videos available for you to select from.

You can pick from a wide range of beautiful audio tracks to play alongside the video clip. In addition to this, you can select quotes &amp; citations by some great personalities to appear while the video is playing.
